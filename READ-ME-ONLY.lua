--[[This King's fork of Alt-QB-Phone if you are still useing a version of QBCore that has a "steam API" key in its server config please use buzzee's main branch 
That can be found at https://github.com/MisterBuzzee/alt-qb-phone
Now follow these step my step instructions:
1:Rename or delete the old qb-phone and put the folder in this get called "qb-phone" in the recourse folder of your server files
 DO NOT JUST PASTE IT OVER CURRENT QB-PHONE WILL CAUSE ISSUES
2:If you plan on using dark sell add mg-pawnshop to your server recourse and ensure it your server.cfg
3:Follow instructions below to add the fine system

If you are using my version of Alt-QB-Phone please don't ask or ping buzzee to help you with it this is a old phone he posted that I just updated to the new core
and as my git profile says im a guy who has no idea what he's doing, so I don't want him dealing with issues i probably caused]]
